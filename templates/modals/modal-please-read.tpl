                    Please note the following important points about your Telephone Service. Your Telephone Service is dependent on your connection to Hyperoptic's Network and the availability of Hyperoptic's Network. In the unlikely event that your Internet Service fails, your Telephone Service will also fail. If your Internet Service or your Telephone Service is terminated, your Telephone Service will fail. Your Telephone Service will also cease to function if there is a power cut or failure. These failures may be caused by reasons outside of our control.
                </p>

                    I understand that this Telephone Service allows calls to the Emergency Services numbers 999 and 112. However I understand that calls will fail if there is a power cut or failure and will also fail in the unlikely event that my Internet Service fails or if my Internet Service or Telephone Service is terminated.
                </p>
                <p class="marg-left-fixed-20 font-15 gray-f-2 pad-right-fixed-15 txt-a-j">
                    I also understand that I need to provide Hyperoptic with the address from which I use the Telephone Service if this is in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland (excluding the Isle of Man or Channel Islands) and that Hyperoptic will pass the address to the UK Emergency Services call centre. If I or anyone else uses my Hyperoptic telephone line to call Emergency Services on 999 or 112 then the Emergency Services will know this address and direct their response to it. I agree that it is my responsibility to keep the address details up to date at all times in my online Hyperoptic account and that this will allow Hyperoptic to provide information about any changes in my address to the Emergency Services. If I do not do so, then the Emergency Services may not know the address from which a 999 or 112 call is made to them.
                </p>

                    If I or anyone else uses the Telephone Service from an address which is outside of England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland then Hyperoptic will not pass my address details to the UK Emergency Services

                <p class="marg-left-fixed-20 font-15 gray-f-2 pad-right-fixed-15 txt-a-j">
                    The address information I provide will take a minimum of 2 working days to be available to the 999/112 emergency call centre operators. That means if I need to dial 999 or 112 from my Hyperoptic line in the meantime, I will need to tell the operator my address.
                </p>

                    By clicking "I Accept" you confirm that you have read and understand how Hyperoptic's Telephone Service connects you to the Emergency Services, how that connection may fail and how our 999/112 Dialling works.
